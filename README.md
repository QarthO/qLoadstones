<b><u>How does it work?</b></u> Right clicking a lodestone with a compass stores the coords inside of it. You can store multiple lodestones. You can then right click the compass and it will open an interactive UI to where you can select a stored location and the compass will now point to it.

These locations are stored in the item. So if you lose the item, you lose your locations. But this means you can also share the item.

Just how you would with a map, you can copy your compass to make dupicates, or lock the compass to prevent adding/removing locations. Even though the compass is a copy, it does not mirror it. This means adding a new location to one compass will not also add it to its copy, or vice versa.
